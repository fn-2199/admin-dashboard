Project: Admin Dashboard from TheOdinProject

This is the sixth project assigned by The Odin Project. The main point of this project was to test our newfound knowledge of the CSS Grid. Although the layout seems very simple, I found myself taking a long time with the alignment. Using flexbox would have been much more efficient, but I wanted to challenge myself by commiting to only using Grid. I noticed that I frequently used "auto" when defining the size of the grid and column tracks. This is so the track sizes defaults to the size of its content. This is exactly why Flexbox would have been more efficient as I am letting the content shape the layout, not the other way around. 

DevTools is pretty useful because the Layout pane gives multiple options for grid elements such viewing track sizes, area names, enabling grid lines, displaying line numbers, and more. I also love the feature that allows you to modify its alignment properties. This prevented me from declaring multiple elements as grid containers under 1 single css rule because I wanted to be able to individually test each grid. I had a difficulty resizing the search bar and I'm not entirely sure if it's due to it being a grid. But the coolest thing I learned from this project was the -webkit-line-clamp property. This permits you to truncate texts in certain lines. With "text-overflow: ellipsis" property, you must use "white-space: nowrap" for it to work and this property puts your entire text into 1 single line.
